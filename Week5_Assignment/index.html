                <h1>Week5 Assignment and Process of my work</h1>
                <p>In this week's assignment, I created an interactive project using P5.js. It includes a pendulum-like ball, with one end of the rod fixed at the center of the canvas and the other attached to the ball. The ball rotates at a constant speed around the center. Additionally, there is a square that rotates 15 degrees clockwise and changes color randomly every time the ball passes its initial position three times. I also used a time function to generate a small square on the canvas at regular intervals.</p>

                <h2>Step1</h2>
                <h3>First I started by adding a couple of main elements: a square, a round ball and a thread.</h3>
                <div style="text-align: center;">
                    <img src="images/Step1.png" alt="Step1" style="width: 600px; height: auto;">
                </div>

                <h2>Step2</h2>
                <h3>In the second step, I attached one end of the thread to the center store of the picture and the other section to the ball.</h3>
                <div style="text-align: center;">
                    <img src="images/Step2.png" alt="Step1" style="width: 600px; height: auto;">
                </div>

                <h2>Step3</h2>
                <h3>In the third step, I had the thread attached to the ball around the center point of the picture.</h3>

                <h2>Step4</h2>
                <h3>Next, I placed the square in the center. Ready to make the connection between the square and the rotation of the ball. I was going to have the square turn 15 degrees clockwise for every 3 revolution of the ball.</h3>

                <h2>Step5</h2>
                <h3>Then I generate a square of random size and color at a random location every time the square rotates.</h3>
