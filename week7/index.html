                <h1>Programming Design Systems</h1>
                
                <h2>Quote #1</h2>
                <h3>“No matter where you go, you are surrounded by systems. We use the word ‘system’ to describe a group of interacting parts as a common whole, and these can be simple, like a watch, or incredibly complex, like the web of computer networks we call the internet.”</h3>
                <p>“Systems are everywhere. Whether it is a simple watch or a complex internet, they are all made up of different parts interacting with each other. This seemingly commonplace observation made me think that everything around me could be a system, and that each part has its own importance. Understanding this, I am better able to explain why design, or any work for that matter, needs to take into account the relationship of the parts, rather than just looking at them individually.</p>
            
                <h2>Quote #2</h2>
                <h3>“The Think Small advertising campaign from 1959 is a great example of how size can be used to emphasize supporting text copy. In this series of magazine ads, an image of the Volkswagen Beetle is printed in different sizes within an otherwise empty canvas.”</h3>
                <p>I find this statement interesting because it provides a concrete example of the concept of “system” mentioned in the previous paragraph. In the “Think Small” campaign, the image of the Volkswagen Beetle is placed on an almost blank canvas in different sizes, which is a clever use of “size” to emphasize the content of the text. This design approach cleverly utilizes “size” to emphasize the textual content. As mentioned in the previous paragraph, the various elements of design (i.e. image, text and space) interact with each other to form a whole. In this advertisement, the combination of image and space focuses the viewer's attention on the text message and reinforces the core content of the advertisement. This approach has given me a better understanding of how to convey an overall message through details in design.</p>
            
                <h2>Quote #3</h2>
                <h3>“The rectangle is a symmetric, solid shape with parallel lines. As it does not exist much in nature, it has become the symbol for civilization itself. 好 ”</h3>
                <p>I find this statement interesting and never thought of it that way before! Rectangles really don't look like common shapes in nature, giving them a very artificial and civilized feel. But thinking about natural substances like crystals and ores, which also often take rectangular shapes, makes me curious. Could it be that these natural rectangular forms could also be associated with symbols of civilization? This reflection made me more interested in the relationship between nature and human design.</p>
            
                <h1>What do Prototypes Prototype?</h1>
                
                <h2>Quote #1</h2>
                <h3>"Even the term 'prototype' is likely to be ambiguous on such a team. Everyone has a different expectation of what a prototype is."</h3>
                <p>I find this idea very interesting because it reveals the complexity of the design process. Although the word “prototype” seems simple, it is defined and understood differently by different professionals. This made me realize that when working across disciplines, it is important to communicate and clarify the expectations of each team member. If the understanding of the prototype is not the same, it may affect the progress of the whole design process.</p>
            
                <h2>Quote #2</h2>
                <h3>"Role refers to questions about the function that an artifact serves in a user’s life—the way in which it is useful to them."</h3>
                <p>This point is very inspiring to me. It turns out that “role” is not just a description of the product's function, but also how the product relates to the user's life and how it provides practical value to the user. This idea made me rethink the core of design: it's not just about solving a problem, it's about creating a meaningful experience.</p>
            
                <h2>Quote #3</h2>
                <h3>"The purpose of the prototype was to quickly convey the proposed role of the artifact to the design team and members of the supporting organization."</h3>
                <p>This point made me realize that especially in the early stages of a project, the main role of a prototype is to clearly articulate to the design and support teams the role and significance of the product in the lives of the users. In this way, the prototype becomes a communication tool, not just a presentation tool.</p>
