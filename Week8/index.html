                <h3>For this week's assignment, I made some changes to the space design mini-game I designed the previous week. Changed from being controlled by the keyboard and mouse to being controlled by hand movements. I accomplished this by using hand pose in ML5.Js.</h3>

                <h3>First I tried the hand movements first, with the tip of the index finger as the control for the player to control the movement of the little flying machine, and the pinching of the index finger and thumb (when the distance reaches close enough) as the trigger to fire the bullet.</h3>
