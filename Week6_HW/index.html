                <p>In this assignment, I designed and implemented a simple flying shooting game. In the game, the player controls an aircraft to shoot bullets and defeat the continuously appearing enemies, including aliens and diamond shapes. To enhance the visual effects of the game, I added diverse styles and dynamic effects to the player's representation, bullets, and score information. Additionally, the UML diagram helped clarify the structure and operation logic of the game.</p>
