                <h3>I designed an alien shooting mini-game that contains a small spaceship that shoots bullets, enemies and gems. The player can move the small spaceship with the X axis of the mouse as well as use space to fire bullets.</h3>

                <h2>Step1</h2>
                <h3>In the first step I created a canvas first, using a more cyber starry background</h3>

                <h2>Step2</h2>
                <h3>In the second step I added a triangle as a flying fighter, this flying fighter is the player. The player can move the flight pieces by manipulating this triangle</h3>

                <h2>Step3</h2>
                <h3>In the third step I added some squares as objects to be dodged falling from the top of the screen at random x-axis positions, and some circles as objects to be “shot”. At the same time I also set the falling objects to disappear when touched using the proximity method.</h3>
